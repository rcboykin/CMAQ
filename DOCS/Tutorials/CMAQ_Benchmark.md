## CMAQ Tutorial ##
### Running the CMAQ Test Case (Benchmarking) ###
Purpose: This tutorial describes how to run the CMAQ test case and use the result to verify the installation of the software.

CMAQv5.2 is distributed with a complete set of input files required for running the CCTM. These data provide useful examples of the input files needed to run the CCTM. They can also be used to benchmark new installations of the software.

Benchmarking refers to a simulation that is used to verify that the software is installed correctly.  Benchmarking CMAQ is recommended in the following circumstances:
- Installation on a new server     
- Following kernel upgrades
- Following Fortran compiler upgrades
- Following netCDF or I/O API library upgrades

### Install CMAQ and Required Libraries

In the directory where you would like to install CMAQ, create the directory issue the following command to clone the EPA GitHub repository for CMAQv5.2:

```
git clone -b 5.2 https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ.git CMAQ_REPO
```

For instructions on installing CMAQ from tarballs, see [Chapter 5](../User_Manual/CMAQ_OGD_ch05_sys_req.md).

#### Configure the CMAQ build environment

*1.* By default, this script will copy configuration, build and run scripts from the repo. An arbitrary folder can be selected by the user by modifying the `CMAQ_HOME` variable in config_cmaq.csh.

*2.* Install the CMAQ libraries and specify their location in the config_cmaq.csh script.

The CMAQ build scripts require the following libraries and INCLUDE files to be available in the CMAQ_LIB directory (Note the CMAQ_LIB gets set automatically by the config_cmaq.csh script, where `CMAQ_LIB = $CMAQ_HOME/lib`):

- netCDF library files are located in the `$CMAQ_LIB/netcdf/lib` directory
- I/O API library and module files are located in the `$CMAQ_LIB/ioapi` directory
- MPI library and INCLUDE files are located in the `$CMAQ_LIB/mpi` directory

The config_cmaq.csh script will automatically link the required libraries into the CMAQ_LIB directory. Set the locations of the netCDF, I/O API, and MPI installations on your Linux system with the following config_cmaq.csh environment variables:

- `setenv IOAPI_MOD_DIR`: the location of the I/O API module files on your system.
- `setenv IOAPI_INCL_DIR`: the location of the I/O API include files on your system.
- `setenv IOAPI_LIB_DIR`: the location of compiled I/O API libraries on your system.       
- `setenv NETCDF_LIB_DIR`: the location of the netCDF installation on your system.
- `setenv MPI_LIB_DIR`: the location of the MPI (OpenMPI or MVAPICH) on your system.

For example, if your netCDF library files are installed in /usr/local/netcdf/lib, set `NETCDF_LIB_DIR` to /usr/local/netcdf/lib. Similarly, if your I/O API library is installed in /home/cmaq/ioapi/Linux2_x86_64ifort, set `IOAPI_LIB_DIR` to /home/cmaq/ioapi/Linux2_x86_64ifort.

*3.* Check the names of the I/O API and netCDF libraries using the `ioapi_lib` and `netcdf_lib` script variables.

*4.* Check the name of the MPI library using the `mpi` script variable. For MVAPICH use `-lmpich`; for openMPI use `-lmpi`.

Links to these libraries will automatically be created when you run any of the build or run scripts. To manually (this is optional) create these libraries, execute the config_cmaq.csh script, identifying the compiler in the command line [intel | gcc | pgi]:

```
source config_cmaq.csh [compiler]
```


### Download CMAQ Test Data

- Download CMAQ test input data by navigating to https://www.cmascenter.org/ and logging into the site using the Log In shortcut on the top horizontal menu.
- Click the Software pulldown menu on the horizontal menu bar and choose CMAQ.
- Click DOWNLOAD on the right-hand side of the page and choose CMAQv5.2, platform, and compiler for your machine and click submit.
- Click "Download Datasets" for the CMAQ benchmark input data and CMAQ benchmark output data.


### Install CMAQ Test Data

Put the CMAQ test data into the CMAQ_HOME directory on your Linux system. From the CMAQv5.2 installation directory, use the following commands to install the data:

```
source config_cmaq.csh
cd $CMAQ_HOME/data
mv /path of downloaded data/CMAQv5.2_Benchmark_SingleDay_Input.tar.gz .
mv /path of downloaded data/CMAQv5.2_Benchmark_SingleDay_Output.tar.gz .
tar xvzf CMAQv5.2_Benchmark_SingleDay_Input.tar.gz
tar xvzf CMAQv5.2_Benchmark_SingleDay_Output.tar.gz
```

### Build the preprocessor executables
_Note: ICON/BCON generation tools are under final stages of development and will be released via GitHub when ready. ICON and BCON files are provided with the benchmark data._

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/icon/scripts
./bldit_icon.csh [compiler] [version] |& tee bldit_icon.log
```

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/bcon/scripts
./bldit_bcon.csh [compiler] [version] |& tee bldit_bcon.log
```

### Run the preprocessor executables
_Note: ICON/BCON generation tools are under final stages of development and will be released via GitHub when ready. ICON and BCON files are provided with the benchmark data._

To run the test simulation for the various CMAQ preprocessor programs, change directories to the location of each program and execute the run script.

Run ICON to produce initial conditions:

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/icon/scripts
./run_icon.csh |& tee run_icon.log
```

Run BCON to produce boundary conditions:

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/bcon/scripts
./run_bcon.csh |& tee run_bcon.log
```

Check the ICON and BCON log file to ensure that the programs completed successfully. Note that CMAQ benchmark simulation "doesn't" actually require that ICON and BCON be run; the test input data include CCTM-ready initial and boundary conditions files.

### Build the CMAQ executable

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/scripts
./bldit_cctm.csh [compiler] [version] |& tee bldit_cctm.log
```

### Run the CCTM Benchmark Script

The default CCTM script in the CMAQ installation is configured to run the single-day benchmark case. You will need to have compiled the CMAQ model builder (Bldmake) and installed the I/O API, netCDF, and MPI libraries before preceding with this step (See [CMAQ OGD Chapter 5](../User_Manual/CMAQ_OGD_ch05_sys_req.md)).  Use the following command to run the CCTM benchmark script:

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/scripts
run_cctm.csh |& tee run.benchmark.log
```
Note that the CCTM run script will need to be configured for the message passing interface (MPI) configuration on your system, including the domain decomposition and number of processors (NPROCS) to use. The default script has an example of how to submit an MPI job:

```
time mpirun -r ssh -np $NPROCS $BLD/$EXEC
```

### Confirm that the Benchmark Simulation Completed

To confirm that the benchmark case ran to completion view the run.benchmark.log file. For MPI runs, check each of the CTM_LOG_[ProcessorID]*.log files. A successful run will contain the following line at the bottom of the log(s):

``>>---->  Program completed successfully  <----<<``

Note: If you are running on multiple processors the log file for each processor is also moved from the $CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/scripts directory to the benchmark output directory: 

```
$CMAQ_DATA/output_CCTM_v52_[compiler]/SE52BENCH 
```
and these log files have the name convention: 

```
CTM_LOG_[ProcessorID].v52_[compiler]_[CASE]/_[RUNDATE].log
CTM_LOG_[ProcessorID].v52_gcc_SE52BENCH_20110701
```

The benchmark output results will have been placed in the directory: 

```
$CMAQ_DATA/output_CCTM_v52_[compiler]_SE52BENCH 
```

and should include 23 netCDF-type files: ACONC, AOD_DIAG, APMDIAG, APMVIS, B3GTS_S, CGRID, CONC, DEPV, DRYDEP, DUSTEMIS, LTNGCOL, LTNGHRLY, MEDIA_CONC, PHOTDIAG1, PHOTDIAG2, PMDIAG, PMVIS, SOILOUT, SSEMIS, VDIFF, VSED, WETDEP1, and WETDEP2.


Common errors in a CCTM simulation include the following:
- Incorrect paths to input files. Look in the CCTM screen output (capture in your log file) for an Error message about an input file not being found.  
- Incorrect MPI implementation. A series of MPI errors at the end of the log file often indicate that the MPI job was not submitted correctly.   

Check the last few lines of the CCTM output log for messages to help diagnose why the simulation did not complete.

### Check the CMAQ Benchmark Results

To determine if CMAQ is correctly installed on your Linux system compare the results from your benchmark simulation to the reference data downloaded from the CMAS Center. These data were generated on a Linux system with the following specifications:
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.11 (Tikanga)
- Linux Kernel 2.6.18-238.12.1.el5 x86_64
- Intel v15.0 compiler, 8 processors with OpenMPI

The CMAQv5.2 reference data include output from BCON, ICON, and the CCTM. You will only need to compare the results for the CCTM to evaluate the benchmark results.

Use your netCDF evaluation tool of choice to evaluate your benchmark results. For example, [VERDI](https://www.verdi-tool.org/) is a visualization tool to view CCTM results as tile plots. Statistical comparison of the results can be made with the I/O API Tools or R. [Chapter 12 of the CMAQ OGD](..//User_Manual/CMAQ_OGD_ch12_analysis_tools.md) lists descriptions of various analysis software options for viewing CMAQ output.

In general, if the largest domain-wide and simulation period differences between your simulation and the reference data are <1%, the model is considered to be successfully benchmarked (i.e., the installation is verified).
