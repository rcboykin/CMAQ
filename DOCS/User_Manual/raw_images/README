The raw images are OmniGraffle documents. It should be straightforward to copy objects so that consistent formatting is used when creating new images. All images are on a white rectangle of a standard size. This allows the images to be exported at standard resolutions for PDF and HTML use.

Exporting the images
----
Select the white background rectangle of the desired figure.
Choose File->Export... 
Set Format to "JPEG bitmap image".
Set the Export Area to "Current Selection" and then switch it to "Region". This will set the region to match the selected area.
For PDF images, set Bitmap Resolution to 300 dots per inch. For HTML images, set Bitmap Resolution to 72 dots per inch.
The JPEG images are stored in /afs/isis/depts/cep/emc/proj/smoke/docs/manual/current/xml/images/ by chapter.
