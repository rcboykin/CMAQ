# CMAQ Installation and System Requirements #

This section describes how to set up and install CMAQ on a Linux system.  The installation instructions in this section guide the user through obtaining the CMAQ source code and installing it on his or her system. Brief instructions for running the CMAQ benchmark case and benchmarking the model are also addressed. Here, the term “benchmarking” refers to the process of verifying that a model has installed correctly on a new computer. CMAQ is distributed with a reference dataset that can be used to benchmark the CMAQ installation. This distribution includes input data (e.g. emissions, land use, meteorology, etc) and reference output data from a CMAQ tun so that results may be compared.

After benchmarking has been successfully completed, the CMAQ system can be configured for other simulations. The same steps that are required to build the model for the benchmark case apply to building it for new simulations. Configuring CMAQ for new applications is covered in [Chapter 10](CMAQ_OGD_ch10_new_simulation.md).

## System Recommendations

All of the CMAQ programs are written in Fortran and are optimized for use on computers running a version of the Linux operating system (OS). Most personal computers (PCs) running a Linux OS are sufficiently powerful to handle basic CMAQ applications. However, to use CMAQ in a production environment where multiple iterations of the model will be executed for different spatial domains and/or emissions control strategies, either a cluster of multiprocessor PCs on a high-end network or an expandable rack-mounted Linux server is recommended.

CMAQ is distributed and supported for executing on Linux operating systems with the Intel Fortran, Portland Group Fortran (PGF), or Gnu Fortran compilers. CMAQ can be ported to most computers running Linux. Documented configurations include the SGI Altix, Red Hat Enterprise, Fedora, Ubuntu, Mandrake, MacOSX, and Suse operating systems. In addition to the Intel and PGF compilers, CMAQ has been built with Sun and Absoft compilers. Information about these ports and up-to-date hardware recommendations are available through the [CMAS Center web site](http://www.cmascenter.org/).

### Hardware

The minimum hardware requirements for running the CMAQ benchmark case are:

-   Linux PC with a single processor
-   1 GB RAM
-   100 GB hard drive storage 

Recommendations on production-level hardware configurations for CMAQ are available on the CMAS Center [Hardware Blog](https://www.airqualitymodeling.org/index.php/CMAS_Hardware_Blog).

### Software

CMAQ requires all of the programs listed in [Table 5‑1](#Table5-1). This list includes the programs distributed with CMAQ. Note that CMAQv5.0 and greater requires I/O API version 3.1. Newer version of CMAQ will not compile with earlier versions of the I/O API library. [Table 5‑2](#Table5-2) lists additional utility software that is not required for running CMAQ, but is useful for model diagnostics and evaluation.

Installing and Compiling CMAQ Source Code
-----------------------------------------

Several steps are required to prepare your Linux system for compiling and running CMAQ. The general sequence for installing CMAQ, including the required support software and libraries is listed here.  

1. Check for Fortran and C compilers on your Linux system.  Install if they are not available.  
2. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (or CVS for older versions of CMAQ).
3. Download the  [I/O API](http://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi) and [netCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) source and install those libraries. Follow the instructions in the documentation for each library on how to build them for your Linux system. Note: It is highly recommended that you use the same compiler for these libraries as you will use to build the CMAQ programs.
4. Install a Message Passing Interface (MPI) library on your Linux system.
5. Download the CMAQ source code and scripts from either the [EPA GitHub Repository](https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ) or the CMAS Center ([<http://www.cmascenter.org>](http://www.cmascenter.org/)). After registering to download CMAQ on the CMAS Center Software Clearinghouse, users are redirected to a page that contains links to download Linux tar files of the CMAQ code, scripts, and benchmark data along with various documents describing the installation and execution processes. *Note that GitHub only provides access to source codes and scripts.  Benchmark input and output data may only be downloaded from EPA or the CMAS Center.*

### Distribution contents

Starting with CMAQv5.2, the structure of the CMAQ repository includes:
- CCTM - Chemistry Transport Model source code, scripts, and release notes
- PREP - Input pre-processing software (e.g., ICON, BCON, MCIP) source code and scripts
- UTIL - Utility software (e.g., BLDMAKE, CHEMMECH, NML) source code and scripts
- POST - Post-processing and analysis software (e.g., COMBINE, HR2DAY, BLDOVERLAY) source code and scripts
- DOCS - This User's Manual, tutorials, and developers guidance 

### Notes on the CMAQ directory structure

When cloning the repository or unpacking the tar file of the CMAQ distribution, the top-level directory is recognized by the default build and run scripts as `CMAQ_HOME` (formerly M3HOME prior to CMAQv5.2). This directory is an arbitrary base location of the CMAQ installation on your Linux system for a specific application. It's up to the user to decide where to install CMAQ. If the user will build and run CMAQ within the repository folder structure, then `CMAQ_HOME` does not need to be set explicitly. If on the other hand, the user wishes to extract the build and run scripts and compile the model outside of the repository, then `CMAQ_HOME` will need to be specified in `bldit_project.csh`. Executing `bldit_project.csh` will automatically perform this extraction and create a CMAQ folder structure under the locatino now specified by `CMAQ_HOME`.

Under `CMAQ_HOME`, the `data` directory serves as a container for the input and output data for the model, and the `lib` directory contains links to the compiled binary library files required to build the CMAQ executables. The CMAQ scripts use the following environment variables to alias the locations of these directories:

`CMAQ_LIB   = $CMAQ_HOME/lib` (M3LIB before CMAQv5.2)<br>
`CMAQ_DATA  = $CMAQ_HOME/data` (M3DATA before CMAQv5.2)

The CMAQ scripts require users to select only the location of the `CMAQ_HOME` directory; the other CMAQ directories are referenced relative to `CMAQ_HOME`. While this directory structure is convenient for the benchmark case and most CMAQ applications, other configurations are possible. Detailed instructions for installing and compiling CMAQ are contained in the next section.


### Configuring your system for compiling CMAQ

Compiler flag consistency between the Fortran and C compilers used to build netCDF and I/O API is critical for building library files compatible with CMAQ. [Table 5-3](#Table5-3) lists the suggested compilation options for building netCDF and I/O API libraries that are compatible with CMAQ. Refer to the documentation for these libraries for additional information on installation and compiling.

<a id=Table5-3></a>

**Table 5‑3. NetCDF and I/O API compilation options for CMAQ**

|**Library Type**|**Intel Fortran**|**PGI Fortran**|**Gnu Fortran**|
|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
|netCDF|`CC = icc`<br> `CPPFLAGS = -DNDEBUG –DpgiFortran` <br>`CFLAGS = -g –O` <br>`FC = ifort` <br>`F77 = ifort`<br>`FFLAGS = –O2 –mp –recursive`<br> `CXX = icpc`|`CC = gcc`<br> `CPPFLAGS = -DNDEBUG –DpgiFortran`<br>`CFLAGS = -O`<br>`FC = pgf90`<br>`FFLAGS = -O –w` <br>`CXX = g++`|`CC = gcc`<br> `CPPFLAGS = -DNDEBUG –DgFortran` <br>`CFLAGS = -O`<br>`FC = gfortran`<br>`FFLAGS = -O –w`<br>`CXX = g++`|
|I/O API 32-bit|BIN = Linux2_x86ifort|BIN = Linux2_x86pg_pgcc_nomp|N/A|
|I/O API 64-bit|BIN = Linux2_x86_64ifort|BIN = Linux2_x86_64pg_pgcc_nomp|BIN = Linux2_x86_64gfort|


#### config_cmaq.csh

Consistency of configuration variables is critical for building CMAQ itself, not just its libraries. Accordingly CMAQ includes the configuration script `config_cmaq.csh` to help enforce consistent environment settings for CMAQ and its associated libraries [Table 5-4](#Table5-4) lists the `config_cmaq.csh` variables defined for the build process and suggests values to which to set those variables.

Note that for multiprocessor applications it is recommended that the Fortran MPI wrapper script `mpif90` be specified for the Fortran compiler (myFC). Using this script, instead of a direct call to the Fortran compiler, will ensure that the full suite of MPI components (libraries and include files) for the compiler are included in the parallel build.

<a id=Table5-4></a>

**Table 5‑4. config_cmaq.csh configuration variables**

| **Variable Name** | **Suggested Value** |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`CMAQ_HOME`|The central CMAQ installation directory. For example, if you installed the CMAQ source code in the directory `/home/user/CMAQ` set CMAQ_HOME with `export CMAQ_HOME=/home/user/CMAQ` for bash or `setenv CMAQ_HOME /home/user/CMAQ` for csh; note that this variable is M3HOME prior to CMAQv5.2|
|`CMAQ_DATA`|Automatically set by config_cmaq.csh; note that this variable is M3DATA prior to CMAQv5.2|
|`CMAQ_LIB`|Automatically set by config_cmaq.csh; note that this variable is M3LIB prior to CMAQv5.2|

|`IOAPI_INCL_DIR`|Location of the I/O API include file installation on your Linux system|
|`IOAPI_LIB_DIR`|Location of the I/O API library installation on your Linux system|
|`NETCDF_LIB_DIR`|Location of the netCDF installation on your Linux system|
|`MPI_LIB_DIR`|Location of the Message Passing Interface installation on your Linux system|
|`netcdf_lib`|Name of the netCDF library on your system;  set to "-lnetcdf" for versions < 4.2.0, "-lnetcdff -lnetcdf" for version 4.2.0 and later|

### Installing CMAQ on your system

Use the following steps to install CMAQ (with examples using a C-shell environment, a Red Hat Linux system, and the Portland Group Fortran compiler) on a Linux system. CMAQ is not distributed with scripts for installing on Windows or MacOSX.

#### Obtain CMAQ source codes ####

CMAQ source code can be installed either using git or from tarballs downloaded from the git repository hosted by GitHub. Both options are described here.

##### Git Installation #####

In the directory where you would like to install CMAQ, issue the following command to clone the official EPA GitHub repository for CMAQv5.2.1:

`git clone -b 5.2.1 https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ CMAQ_REPO`

##### Zipfile Installation #####

Zipfiles of the CMAQ source code are available from the public GitHub repository. Click the button "Clone or download" from https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ/tree/5.2.1 and select "Download ZIP" to download a Zipfile of the CMAQv5.2.1 repository. Alternatively, you may download the zipfile from the [EPA CMAQ website](https://www.epa.gov/cmaq/access-cmaq-source-code).

Reference input/output data for testing the installation of the software are available from the CMAS Center; *data are not available through GitHub*. You must register/login to access the source codes and data from the CMAS Center.

In the directory where you would like to install CMAQ, unzip the model distribution file:

`unzip CMAQ-5.2.1.zip`

The following directories will be created:

```
CMAQ-5.2.1/CCTM
CMAQ-5.2.1/PREP
CMAQ-5.2.1/POST
CMAQ-5.2.1/UTIL
CMAQ-5.2.1/DOCS
```

The Git and zipfile installation options will produce slightly different subdirectories on your Linux system. The base installation directory using the git clone commmand will be `CMAQ_REPO`; the directory from the zipfile will be `CMAQ-5.2.1`.  The subesquent instructions in this guide will be based on the git clone installation. For Zipfile installations, replace CMAQ_REPO with CMAQ-v5.2.1 in the instructions that follow. The differences in the directory names highlights the difference in functionality between the two options. Cloning the repository gives the user access to the full repository and its history, while downloading the zip file will only give access to version 5.2.1.

Using the git clone option, CMAQ will install into the following directories:

```
CMAQ_REPO/CCTM
CMAQ_REPO/PREP
CMAQ_REPO/POST
CMAQ_REPO/UTIL
CMAQ_REPO/DOCS
```

#### Build and run in a user-specified directory outside of the repository
In the top level of CMAQ_REPO, the bldit_project.csh script will automatically replicate the CMAQ folder structure and copy every build and run script out of the repository so that you may modify them freely without version control.

In bldit_project.csh, modify the variable $CMAQ_HOME to identify the folder that you would like to install the CMAQ package under. For example:
```
set CMAQ_HOME = /home/username/CMAQ_v5.2.1
```
Now execute the script.
```
./bldit_project.csh
```
#### Install the CMAQ Libraries
The CMAQ build scripts require the following libraries and INCLUDE files to be available in the CMAQ_LIB directory (Note the CMAQ_LIB gets set automatically by the config_cmaq.csh script, where `CMAQ_LIB = $CMAQ_HOME/lib`):

- netCDF library files are located in the `$CMAQ_LIB/netcdf/lib` directory
- I/O API library and module files are located in the `$CMAQ_LIB/ioapi` directory
- MPI library and INCLUDE files are located in the `$CMAQ_LIB/mpi` directory

The config_cmaq.csh script will automatically link the required libraries into the CMAQ_LIB directory. Set the locations of the netCDF, I/O API, and MPI installations on your Linux system with the following config_cmaq.csh environment variables:

- `setenv IOAPI_MOD_DIR`: the location of the I/O API module files on your system.
- `setenv IOAPI_INCL_DIR`: the location of the I/O API include files on your system.
- `setenv IOAPI_LIB_DIR`: the location of compiled I/O API libraries on your system.
- `setenv NETCDF_LIB_DIR`: the location of the netCDF installation on your system.
- `setenv MPI_LIB_DIR`: the location of the MPI (OpenMPI or MVAPICH) on your system.

For example, if your netCDF libraries are installed in /usr/local/netcdf/lib, set `NETCDF` to /usr/local/netcdf/lib. Similarly, if your I/O API library is installed in /home/cmaq/ioapi/Linux2_x86_64ifort, set `IOAPI_LIB` to /home/cmaq/ioapi/Linux2_x86_64ifort.

*1.* Check the names of the I/O API and netCDF libraries using the `ioapi_lib` and `netcdf_lib` script variables.

*2.* Check the name of the MPI library using the `mpi` script variable. For MVAPICH use `-lmpich`; for openMPI use `-lmpi`.

Links to these libraries will automatically be created when you run any of the build or run scripts. To manually create these libraries (this is optional), execute the config_cmaq.csh script, identifying the compiler in the command line [intel | gcc | pgi]:
```
source config_cmaq.csh [compiler]
```
You may also identify the version of the compiler if you wish it to be identified in build directory and executable names. This is optional. For example:
```
source config_cmaq.csh intel 17.0
```
When you source the config_cmaq.csh script the CMAQ directories, including all required libraries will be installed in the CMAQ working directory.  If you encounter errors about libraries not being found, check the settings of the config_cmaq.csh script variables IOAPI, NETCDF, or MPI to ensure that they are correctly point to the locations of these libraries on your Linux system.

#### Install the CMAQ input reference/benchmark data ####

Download the CMAQ single day reference data from the [CMAS Center Software Clearinghouse](https://www.cmascenter.org/download/software.cfm) and copy to `$CMAQ_DATA`. Navigate to the `$CMAQ_DATA` directory, unzip and untar the single day benchmark input and output files:

```
cd $CMAQ_DATA
tar xvzf CMAQv5.2.1_Benchmark_SingleDay_Input.tar.gz
tar xvzf CMAQv5.2.1_Benchmark_SingleDay_Output.tar.gz
```
This will produce the following subdirectories:

```
  CMAQ_REPO/data/SE52BENCH/single_day/cctm_input
  emis/
  icbc/
  land/
  lightning/
  met/
```

#### Compiling CMAQ ####

For all CMAQ programs (other than MCIP), the program Bldmake is used to compile the source code into executables. The first step in the compilation of CMAQ is to compile Bldmake. Bldmake will then be used to compile the CMAQ programs.  *Note that the compiler paths and flags are all set in the config_cmaq.csh script and then passed along to the build scripts*. None of the CMAQ build scripts contain compiler settings. Instead, the build scripts for each program reference the config_cmaq.csh script using the Linux command “source”. See [Table 5-4](#Table5-4) for a description of the compilation flags in the config_cmaq.csh script.

Note that every build and run script will source the config_cmaq.csh configuration script in order to ensure consistency in computing environment conditions. When executing each script, you will need to specify the compiler and (if desired) the compiler version as documented above for the config_cmaq.csh execution.

All of the CMAQ programs other than CCTM are run in single-processor mode. CCTM may be run either in single-processor (serial) mode or in parallel on multiple processors. Program-specific compilation instructions are provided below. These compilation instructions are for building executables for simulating the test data sets distributed with CMAQ. Additional information about the configuration options for the various CMAQ programs is provided in [Chapter 4](CMAQ_OGD_ch04_science.md) and [Chapter 7](CMAQ_OGD_ch07_programs_libraries.md).

##### Compile Bldmake #####

In CMAQv5.2.1, bldmake is compiled automatically the first time you run any of the CMAQ build scripts. If you prefer to run the build as a separate step, the bldmake build script is in $CMAQ_REPO/UTIL/bldmake/scripts.

##### Compile the CMAQ programs #####

Create the model executables for ICON, BCON, MCIP, and CCTM.

ICON and BCON can be configured for different chemical mechanisms and for different kinds of input data. The configuration options for ICON and BCON are discussed in detail in [Chapter 7](CMAQ_OGD_ch07_programs_libraries.md).

Use the following commands to compile ICON and BCON:

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/icon
bldit_icon.csh [compiler] [version] |& tee build_icon.log

cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/bcon
bldit_bcon.csh  [compiler] [version] |& tee build.bcon.log

where,

[compiler] can be either intel, pgi, or gcc
[version] is the version number of the compiler, e.g. 4.8.1
```

Like the program Bldmake, MCIP is compiled using a Fortran Makefile.

Use the following commands to compile MCIP:

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/mcip/src
source ../../../config_cmaq.csh
make |& tee make.mcip.log
```

The CCTM has multiple configuration options that can be changed to optimize model performance for different applications. In addition to selecting the chemical mechanism to model gas-phase chemistry, the user can also select from several different science modules. The science configuration options for CCTM are discussed in detail in [Chapter 4](CMAQ_OGD_ch04_science.md) and [Chapter 7](CMAQ_OGD_ch07_programs_libraries.md). The distribution CCTM build script is configured to create a multiprocessor executable for the installation test simulation. For multiprocessor applications, CMAQ uses the message passing interface (MPI) to manage communication between processors in a clustered multiprocessor computing environment. The location of the MPI include and library files on your Linux system are specified in the config_cmaq.csh script.

For single-processor (serial) systems, configure the CCTM build script to create a single-processor executable by commenting out the line that activates the variable “ParOpt” of the CCTM build script. Use the following commands to compile CCTM:

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/CCTM/scripts
bldit_cctm.csh [compiler] [version] |& tee build_cctm.log
```

The programs CHEMMECH and CALMAP are also not needed for the test simulation but can be compiled using Makefiles.

### Running the CMAQ Installation Test Simulation

After successfully compiling the various CMAQ programs, use the distributed run scripts to generate the CCTM input files and then to run CCTM for the CMAQ benchmark case. CCTM must be run last in the simulation sequence; MCIP must be run first. Note however that CMAQ-ready meteorology data are distributed with the CMAQ test case, which means that MCIP does not actually need to be run to test the model installation. With the exception of MCIP, there are no dependencies among the other CMAQ programs, so they can be run in any order to create input data for CCTM.

To run the test simulation for the various CMAQ programs, change directories to the location of each program and execute the run script.

Run ICON to produce initial conditions:

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/icon
./run_icon.csh |& tee run_icon.log
```

Run BCON to produce boundary conditions:

```
cd $CMAQ_HOME/PREP/bcon
./run_bcon.csh |& tee run_bcon.log
```

Check the ICON and BCON log file to ensure that the programs completed successfully.

The CCTM is configured by default to run in multiprocessor mode. This mode requires run time settings that specify the number of processors to allocate to the simulation and the location of the MPI initialization command (mpirun) on your system. Set the number of processors to use for the simulation by setting the number of rows (NPROW) and columns (NPCOL) to use for the MPI domain decomposition. The product of NPCOLS and NPROWS is the number of processors to use for the CCTM run. For example, if you have a system with six processors available to run CMAQ, set NPCOL to 3 and NPROW to 2; the total number of processors (NPROCS) is automatically set by the script.

For an MPI configuration with 6 processors,

```
@ NPCOL = 3; @ NPROW = 2
```

Most clustered multiprocessor systems require a command to start the MPI run-time environment. The default CCTM run script uses the *mpirun* command. Consult your system administrator to find out how to invoke MPI when running multiprocessor applications. For single-processor computing, set NPROCS to 1, NPCOL to 1, and NPROW to 1

For single-processor computing, set NPCOL_NPROW to "1 1":

```
setenv NPCOL_NPROW "1 1"
```

After configuring the MPI settings for your Linux system, using the following command to run the CCTM. Per the note above, different Linux systems have different requirements for submitting MPI jobs.  The command below is an example of how to submit the CCTM run script and may differ depending on the MPI requirements of your Linux system. 

```
./run_cctm.csh |& tee cctm.log
```

### Benchmarking
Benchmarking is the process of confirming that the model source code compiles and executes correctly on a new computer system. CMAQ should be benchmarked on a computing system before the model is used for research or regulatory applications on that system. The purpose of benchmarking is to ensure that there are no inconsistencies introduced into the model solution from local system parameters, such as compilers, processors, or operating systems. While differences are expected in the CMAQ results produced by different operating systems, hardware, and compilers, these differences should be small and within the numerical error of the model. Input and output reference data are packaged with CMAQ to use for benchmarking the model on new systems. After running the test case packaged with the source code, compare the results against the reference data provided in the CMAQ distribution.

#### CMAQ benchmark parameters
The CMAQ benchmark test case is a single day simulation for July 1, 2011 on a 100 column x 80 row x 35 layer 12-km resolution domain over the southeast U.S. The CCTM configuration parameters for the benchmark test case include the following:

-   Multiprocessor simulation
-   Horizontal advection: Yamo
-   Vertical advection: WRF
-   Horizontal diffusion: Multiscale
-   Vertical diffusion: ACM2
-   Deposition: M3Dry
-   Chemistry solver: EBI
-   Aerosol module: AERO6
-   Cloud module: ACM_AE6
-   Mechanism: cb6r3_ae6_aq
-   Lightning NOx emissions calculated with hourly NLDN strike data
-   Dynamic vertical diffusivity
-   In-line deposition velocities
-   Surface HONO interaction
-   In-line biogenic emissions
-   In-line plume rise
-   In-line windblown dust emissions
-   Bi-directional ammonia flux
-   No stratosphere-troposphere ozone exchange

The system configuration parameters used to generate the benchmark reference data include the following:
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.11 (Tikanga)
- Linux Kernel 2.6.18-238.12.1.el5 x86_64
- Intel v15.0 compiler, 8 processors with OpenMPI

#### CMAQ Benchmark Results

  After completing the CMAQ benchmark case, the CCTM output files can be compared with the reference datasets provided in the CMAQ distribution. The reference data for CMAQ are available from the CMAS Center Software Clearinghouse. The reference data may be compared to the results from your simulation using tile plots of differences, grid-cell statistics (minimum/maximum differences), and domain-wide statistics. See [Chapter 12](CMAQ_OGD_ch12_analysis_tools.md) for a list of analysis tools that are available for comparing two model simulations.

  Domain-wide differences between the reference data and your simulation results for each model species and each simulation time step (hourly) of less than 1% indicate a successful benchmarking of the software on a Linux system.  While larger differences may indicate a problem with the installation, they may also point to a configuration discrepancy in the benchmark simulation.  Review the compiler optimization flags and the CCTM configuration that you used to resolve differences with the reference data.

  Support for CMAQ is available from the CMAS Center (see [Chapter 13](CMAQ_OGD_ch13_support.md)).
