# Summary of CMAQv5.2 Updates

The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model version 5.2 is a major update to CMAQ that includes several changes to the science algorithms in the base model.  CMAQ v5.2 was developed by the U.S. EPA with contributions from other research partners. Summarized below are the main enhancements to the modeling system since the previous release, CMAQ v5.1.

## Chemistry
### Photochemistry
There are 10 unique gas-phase chemical mechanisms in CMAQv5.2. These are all located in the MECHS/ folder and may be invoked when building the model and Makefile. Variations of Carbon Bond 5 (CB05), Carbon Bond 6 (CB6), RACM2, and SAPRC07 are all available. Specific science updates include the following:  
  * [CMAQv5.2 Photochemical Mechanisms](CMAQv5.2_Mechanisms.md)
  * [Implementation of CB6r3](CB6_release_notes.md)
  * [Implementation of CB05eh51: Bromine and Iodine Chemistry](Halogen_Chemistry.md)  

Structural updates to the chemistry module in general include:  
  * [Brute force no chemistry capacity](Brute_force_no_chemistry_capacity.md)
  * [RXNS_DATA modules now comply to FORTRAN 132 column limit](MECHS_RXNS_DATA_MODULEs_comply_to_FORTRAN_132_column_limit.md)

### Photolysis Rates
Updates to the treatment of photolysis rates online include:
  * [Updates to the OMI data file](In-Line_Photolysis_Updates_to_the_OMI_data_file.md)
  * [In-line Photolysis CLOUD_OPTICS.F fixed for possible floating point error](In-line_Photolysis_CLOUD_OPTICS.F_fixed_for_possible_floating_point_error.md)

### Aerosol Processes
The aerosol module has undergone significant changes that affect both its structure and the science it represents. Major science updates include the following:
  * [Semivolatile POA and pcSOA implementation](SemiVolPOA_pcSOA.md)
  * [New Organic Compound Properties](SOA_properties.md)

  * [Update to Speciation of coarse-mode aerosol](Coarse_Aerosol_Speciation.md)

The following structural updates ensure consistent treatment of aerosols in CMAQv5.2 and flexibility as the code is developed in the future:
  * [Consolidation of aero module and increased flexibility in AERO_DATA table](aero6_6i_6mp_consolidation.md)
  * [Consistent treatment of aerosol water contribution to second and third aerosol moments](Aerosol_Moment_Consistency.md)
  * [Check for feasible aerosol size distirbution properties from initial and boundary conditions](IC_BC_Aerosol_Size_Conditioner.md)

The following updates affect how aerosol concentrations from CMAQ output may be interpreted when evaluated against observation data:
  * [PM Diagnsotic files have been enhanced to provide more detailed and robust information about CMAQ particulate properties](PM_Diagnostic_Files.md)
  * [Transmission Factors for PM<sub>1</sub> and AMS size-dependent collection have been added and are output in the diagnostic routine](Aerosol_Transmission_Factors.md)

  * [Multiple fire inputs capability](Multiple_Fire_Inputs.md)

Improvements to speciation and error checking:  
  * [Online speciation of biogenic VOCs from BEIS is now available and customizable](GSPRO.md)
