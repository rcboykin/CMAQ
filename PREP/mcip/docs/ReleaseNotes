********************************************************************************
Announcing the release of MCIP Version 4.5 (16 March 2018)
********************************************************************************

The MCIP code is updated to version 4.5.  These release notes and the change
log reflect all changes that have been made to MCIP since MCIPv4.4 (the last
official release).  Changes to MCIPv4.5 were made by Tanya Spero (U.S. EPA).
User contributions are also noted below.  The detailed list of changes to the
MCIP code is in the CHANGES file, which is part of the MCIP tar file in the
"doc" sub-directory.

MCIPv4.5 requires I/O API version 3.1 or greater to support error-checking
within the I/O API.

MCIPv4.5 requires the netCDF F90 module (rather than the F77 include).

Users are encouraged to read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file,
which is located in the MCIP tar file in the "doc" sub-directory.

***Users should consult the FAQ before submitting inquiries to M3User,
   CMAS, or the code developers.***

MCIPv4.5 has been tested with the following Fortran compilers under both debug
and optimized options at various stages of development:  Intel 17.0.3, PGI 17.4,
and GCC 4.8.5.  MCIPv4.5 has been tested with netCDF 4.4.1, and I/O API 3.1 and
3.2.  Final testing of MCIPv4.5 was conducted with Intel 17.0.3


With MCIPv4.5, the following are now deprecated:
  - Support for MM5v3 input
  - Including "SOIM1", "SOIM2", "SOIT1", and "SOIT2" in METCRO2D.
    Those fields are now in a separate file that includes all soil layers and
    their associated depths (SOI_CRO).
  - Including "LUFRAC_xx" in GRIDCRO2D.  Those fields are now in a separate
    file that includes each fractional land use classification (LUFRAC_CRO).

With MCIPv4.5, the following output variables in METCRO2D remain deprecated:
     - 2-D cloud fraction (CFRAC)
     - cloud top (CLDT)
     - cloud bottom (CLDB)
     - liquid water content (WBAR)
They will be removed from METCRO2D in a forthcoming release of MCIP.


Interactions with members of the CMAQ user community led to some of the changes
that have been incorporated into MCIPv4.5.


The following is a summary of the changes in MCIPv4.5:

 1.  Prevent MCIP from using meteorology initialization time period.
     Otherwise gives unrealistic solutions for near-surface fields that are
     undefined at that time and causes segmentation fault with Noah
     land-surface model data from WRF on some compilers.

 2.  Made minor changes to accommodate WRF implementation of MODIS land use
     with category 21 representing "lake" for PURB. (Was overlooked in MCIPv4.4)

 3.  Added snow height (SNOWH) from WRF to METCRO2D output.

 4.  Added capability to read and process data from Noah *Mosaic* land-surface
     model in WRF via MCIP.

 5.  Created new M3 I/O API files for data within soil layers (SOI_CRO), for
     fractional land use (LUCRAC_CRO), and (if available) Noah mosaic land-
     surface model (MOSAIC_CRO).

 6.  Refined calculation of interval between WRF output times to account for
     small drifts when advection time steps do not fall exactly on the hour.

 7.  Created a minimum value for rainfall in order to avoid underflow
     condition.  (Otherwise causes segmentation fault with GCC compiler.)

 8.  Updated script to delete (rather than overwrite) existing MCIP output
     files.

 9.  Updated compiler option details in Makefile.

10.  Added preliminary support for hybrid vertical coordinate in WRF, but
     disabled the effects pending additional modfications and testing in CMAQ.

11.  Corrected error in calculation of dot-point latitude and longitude for
     polar stereographic WRF.  (Not used within CMAQ).

12.  Added spectral nudging details to metadata.

13.  Corrected minor errors in print statements (benign).

14.  Changed initial value for an MM5 field from INTEGER to REAL (benign).

15.  Removed unused variables from various routines (benign).
