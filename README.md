CMAQv5.3.b2 (beta version)
===========

Community Multiscale Air Quality Model US EPA CMAQ Website: (https://www.epa.gov/cmaq).

CMAQ is an active open-source development project of the U.S. EPA Computational Exposure Division
that consists of a suite of programs for conducting air quality model simulations.
CMAQ is supported by the CMAS Center: (http://www.cmascenter.org).

CMAQ combines current knowledge in atmospheric science and air quality modeling with multi-processor
computing techniques in an open-source framework to deliver fast, technically sound estimates of ozone,
particulates, toxics, and acid deposition.

## The purpose of CMAQv5.3 beta release

CMAQv5.3b2 is a development version that is not intended for regulatory or research application use. The purpose of releasing the development
version is to give community members:

* a reasonable amount of time to complete any pending feature submissions they would like to submit for the stable release.
* a role in helping to test, troubleshoot, and debug the unofficial code before the stable release.
* an opportunity to comment on the code improvements made in the new version.
* the ability to take advantage of improvements for preliminary studies of their own interest.
* a reasonable amount of time to ensure the new version is compatible with any features the member may have submitted in the past.

**Community contributions are highly sought:**
* Test the beta release and post issues and feedback via GitHub.
* Submit model developments via GitHub. Check out our [Developers' Guide](DOCS/Developers_Guide/CMAQ_Dev_Guide.md).  
* Please notify our team early if you are interested in submitting a contribution to allow for coordination, testing, etc.


## Getting the CMAQ Repository
This CMAQ Git archive is organized with each official public release stored as a branch on the main USEPA/CMAQ repository.
To clone code from the CMAQ Git archive, specify the branch (i.e. version number) and issue the following command from within
a working directory on your server:

```
git clone -b 5.3.b2 https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ.git CMAQ_REPO
```

## CMAQ Repository Guide
Source code and scripts are organized as follows:
* **CCTM (CMAQ Chemical Transport Model):** code and scripts for running the 3D-CTM at the heart of CMAQ.
* **DOCS:** Release notes for the release version of CMAQ, CMAQ User's Guide, developers guidance, short tutorials and known issues.
* **PREP:** Data preprocessing tools for important input files like initial and boundary conditions, etc.
* **POST:** Data postprocessing tools for aggregating and evaluating CMAQ output products (e.g. Combine, Site-Compare, etc)
* **UTIL:** Utilities for generating code and using CMAQ (e.g. chemical mechanism generation, IO-API, etc)

## Documentation
Release notes and Code documentation are included within this repository (they are version-controlled along with the code itself).  
*Note: CMAQv5.3 updates to the Tutorials and User's Guide will be included in the final v5.3 release in Spring 2019.*
